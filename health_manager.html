      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>To better protect students' bodies, I came up with a mobile app with a
        search board, a check list and a freezer page. Functions of this app are
        exploring the wholesome food, offering markets' locations, comparing prices,
        recommendations for a healthy diet and reminders for the expiration date
        of the food.This app could take care of the students' eating habits and
        solve their issues from buying food to consuming food.</p>

    <div class="research textbox">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To better understand my design challenge and the actual problems the
        students are facing in the universities, I investigated target users and
        find out what are their demands when living far away from parents.</p>
      <p>Understanding Users</p>
      <p>First, after the investigation, I have learned about the demand of users.
         I divided them into two types, cook and don't cook. They have commons and
         differences. Both types want to change their eating habit, buy food at
         lower price and eat diversily.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="second textbox">
      <p>Secondly, I have learned about critical issues and eating habits from users.
         They concerned about the distance of the market and care more about diversity
         of the food sold in the market.</p>

      <p>Thirdly, according to previous investigation and analysis, I made three
        personas representing three main types of students.</p>

    <div class="market textbox">
      <h2>Marketing Research</h2>
      <p>Based on the Interviews, I collected the important features. Based on
        these features, I chose four apps as competitors. It seems like that some
        necessary functions are not combined and the scope of the apps are not
         highly related with the demand of the college students.</p>

    <div class="ideation textbox">
      <h2>Six Solutions</h2>
      <p>Based on the research, I started the design through sketches, ranging
        from mobile app to VR markets. I have came up with six solutions to help
        the students solve four problems: where to buy, what is healthier, what
        is cheaper, when should eat.</p>

      <h2>Work Flow</h2>
      <p>Depending on the users' demands, the whole working process was clarified
        to make sure the flow is workable and smooth.</p>

      <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
      <p>I sketched draft of  mobile interfaces on the paper, which contains the
        functions of exploring, managing the freezer, checklist and profile.
        This helps to check the whole workflow.</p>
